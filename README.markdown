jQuery Placeholder Plugin
=========================

A plugin to make HTML5's placeholder attribute work in non-HTML5-supporting
browsers.

This is currently a work in progress to simplify http://github.com/mudge/jquery_example
and to delegate functionality to the browser where possible.

Usage
-----

Simply use the `placeholder` attribute on your `input` tags and include 
`jquery.placeholder.js` somewhere in your page.
